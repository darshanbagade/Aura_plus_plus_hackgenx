## Problem :

Large public spaces like malls, hospitals, and airports struggle with maintaining cleanliness throughout the day. Traditional cleaning relies on manual inspections and fixed schedules, which often:

- Miss real-time hygiene issues like spills or litter  
- Lead to safety risks and unpleasant visitor experiences  
- Waste staff time and cleaning resources  

> There's a clear need for a smarter, proactive approach.

## Our Solution :

We built an AI-powered monitoring system that automates spill and garbage detection using CCTV feeds. Here's how it works:

* Live Monitoring  
  - Connects to existing CCTV cameras to continuously monitor public areas.

* AI Detection  
  - Processes live footage using object detection to identify spills and garbage.

* Instant Alerts  
  - When an issue is detected, an alert is sent to the cleaning team via app or dashboard.

* Task Assignment  
  - Automatically assigns the task to the nearest available crew member.

* Manager Oversight  
  - Enables facility managers to track incidents, response times, and team efficiency.
